# meeting-app

Gelen Gelsin is a mobile application developed for university students to make campus life more social and interactive. The app offers students opportunities to organize social events, participate in activities, and meet new people. Gelen Gelsin is a platform designed to strengthen social connections and make campus life more vibrant.

The project is currently in development, with ongoing work focused on active user experience and the integration of various features. Not all features have been finalized yet, and continuous updates and improvements are being made.

This is a project Iâ€™m working on with a few friends to enhance student life on campus.
